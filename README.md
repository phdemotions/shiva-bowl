## Rules

### Keepers

- Keepers were started during the 2019 draft
- Owners are able to keep up to 2 players from their previous yearâ€™s team, although they are not required to keep anyone.
- Keepers will cost the draft pick of whatever round they were drafted in the first year (e.g.  someone picked in the 10th round this year, they will cost a 10th rounder to keep next year)
- If a player is kept two years in a row, it will cost one higher round pick to keep that player (e.g. someone picked in the 10th round this year will cost a 10th round pick next year and a 9th round pick two years from now)
- If the same player is kept for more than two years, they will cost a first rounder for the remaining years (e.g. someone picked in the 10th round this year will cost a 10th round pick next year, a 9th round pick two years from now, and a 1st round pick three years from now)
- A keeper tag can only be used on a player for 4 straight years (i.e. a player drafted this year is not eligible to be kept by the same team five years from now) UNLESS they make it to free agency.
- Players TRADED are still subject to the same rules as if they were drafted by their new team (e.g. if a player kept for a 10th round pick last year is traded, the team that traded for him can keep him at the cost of a 9th rounder this year and a first rounder for two additional years)
- Players picked up before a season begins can be kept by the new team at the cost of a last round pick.
- Players dropped by a team and picked up by any team mid-season via the WAIVER PRIORITY can be kept by the new team at the cost of the round the player was drafted at that year (e.g. a player who was drafted in the 10th round in 2019 cost a 10th rounder in 2020, a 9th rounder in 2021, then was dropped. An owner who picks that player up off of waivers can keep that player for a first rounder in 2022 and 2023, IF that player never made it through waivers unclaimed).
- Players dropped by a team and picked up by any team mid-season via FREE AGENCY can be kept by the new team at the cost of a last round pick.
