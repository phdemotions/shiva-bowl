## Rules

### Keepers

- Keepers were started during the 2019 draft
- Owners are able to keep up to 2 players from their previous yearâ€™s team, although they are not required to keep anyone.
- Keepers will cost the draft pick of whatever round they were drafted in the first year (e.g.  someone picked in the 10th round this year, they will cost a 10th rounder to keep next year)
- If a player is kept two years in a row, it will cost one higher round pick to keep that player (e.g. someone picked in the 10th round this year will cost a 10th round pick next year and a 9th round pick two years from now)
- If the same player is kept for more than two years, they will cost a first rounder for the remaining years (e.g. someone picked in the 10th round this year will cost a 10th round pick next year, a 9th round pick two years from now, and a 1st round pick three years from now)
- A keeper tag can only be used on a player for 4 straight years (i.e. a player drafted this year is not eligible to be drafted by the same team four years from now draft) UNLESS they make it to free agency.
- Players TRADED are still subject to the same rules as if they were drafted by their new team (e.g. if a player drafted in the 10th round this year is traded, the team that traded for him can keep him at the cost of a 10th rounder next year, a 9th rounder the following year, and a first rounder for two additional years)
- Players picked up before a season begins can be kept by the new team at the cost of a last round pick.
- Players dropped by a team and picked up by any team mid-season via the WAIVER PRIORITY can be kept by the new team at the cost of the round the player was drafted at that year (e.g. someone who was drafted in the 10th round in 2019 cost a 10th rounder in 2020, a 9th rounder in 2021, and a first rounder in 2022 and 2023, IF they never make it through waivers unclaimed).
- Players dropped by a team and picked up by any team mid-season via FREE AGENCY can be kept by the new team at the cost of a last round pick.
